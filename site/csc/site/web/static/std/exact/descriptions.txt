initial hierarchical graph
this is the initial solution: cabababc
we now double every edge of the initial solution
 
we now start collapsing
process ababc
we will now collapse the edges abab->ababc->babc
 
ababc is an input node so we cannot collapse its pair of edges
process cabab
we will now collapse the edges caba->cabab->abab
 
cabab is an input node so we cannot collapse its pair of edges
process abab
we will now collapse the edges aba->abab->bab
 
we will now collapse the edges aba->abab->bab
 
we will now collapse the edges aba->abab->bab
 
there no lower edges, skip this node
process baba
we will now collapse the edges bab->baba->aba
 
baba is an input node so we cannot collapse its pair of edges
process babc
we will now collapse the edges bab->babc->abc
 
there no lower edges, skip this node
process caba
we will now collapse the edges cab->caba->aba
 
there no lower edges, skip this node
process aba
we will now collapse the edges ab->aba->ba
 
we will now collapse the edges ab->aba->ba
 
there no lower edges, skip this node
process abc
we will now collapse the edges ab->abc->bc
 
there no lower edges, skip this node
process bab
we will now collapse the edges ba->bab->ab
 
we will now collapse the edges ba->bab->ab
 
there no lower edges, skip this node
process cab
we will now collapse the edges ca->cab->ab
 
there no lower edges, skip this node
process ab
we will now collapse the edges a->ab->b
 
we will now collapse the edges a->ab->b
 
we will now collapse the edges a->ab->b
 
there no lower edges, skip this node
process ba
we will now collapse the edges b->ba->a
 
the pair of edges b->ba->a cannot be mirrored as it would break connectivity
process bc
we will now collapse the edges b->bc->c
 
there no lower edges, skip this node
process ca
we will now collapse the edges c->ca->a
 
there no lower edges, skip this node
process a
we will now collapse the edges eps->a->eps
 
we will now collapse the edges eps->a->eps
 
there no lower edges, skip this node
process b
we will now collapse the edges eps->b->eps
 
we will now collapse the edges eps->b->eps
 
there no lower edges, skip this node
process c
we will now collapse the edges eps->c->eps
 
we will now collapse the edges eps->c->eps
 
the pair of edges eps->c->eps cannot be mirrored as it would break connectivity
Done!
